Testimonial Quote:
"I sent Pete a voice memo I'd been sitting on for months. He heard what I was trying to say and helped me actually say it. The finished song sounds like me, just... more."
— Sarah J. // "Midnight in Tokyo"

MANIFESTO SECTION
Section Title: How I Work
Intro Text:
I believe the process of making music matters as much as the finished song. Here's what that looks like in practice.

Pillar 1: 
The Process Is the Purpose
There's a version of music-making that skips the work entirely. Generate a track, get a result, move on. I'm not interested in that, and I don't think you are either. The process of making a song - the decisions, the discoveries, the moments where it clicks - that's where the meaning lives. That's where you become the artist who made the thing. My job is to guide that process, not bypass it.

Pillar 2:
Song First
Before we start tracking, I want to understand your song inside and out. What's it really about? What's the feeling you're chasing? Sometimes that conversation sparks ideas for arrangement or production. Sometimes it just gives us clarity. Either way, every decision we make from there is in service of what you've already written.

Pillar 3: Real Performances by Real Humans
I'm not interested in making music that sounds like it was assembled from parts. We'll capture actual performances: yours, mine, and when needed, session musicians I trust. The goal is music that breathes and feels like it was made by people who care.

Pillar 4: It's Your Sound
This is collaborative, not "hand it off and hope for the best." You'll be involved at every stage, giving feedback as the song develops. I bring technical skills and creative ideas, but the song stays yours. I'm here to serve what you're trying to say, not impose my vision on top of it.

30-DAY TIMELINE
Section Title: The 30-Day Process
Week 1: Vision & Discovery
We start with a real conversation about your song, your influences, and what you're hoping this track becomes. I'll listen to your demo more times than you'd expect, pulling out the details that make it yours. By the end of the week, we'll have a clear production direction and often a rough demo that serves as our roadmap.
Week 2: Building the Foundation
This is where the song starts taking shape. We'll track drums and rhythm section, make arrangement decisions, and establish the sonic world of the track. You'll hear it evolve from voice memo to something with bones. Regular check-ins mean nothing moves forward without you feeling good about it.
Week 3: Vocals & Performance
The heart of the record. We'll capture your lead vocal when you're ready, not rushed, not overthought. Then backing vocals, harmonies, and any final overdubs that serve the song. This is also where we do the detail work: editing, tuning, and making sure every performance feels right.
Week 4: Mix, Master & Delivery
I'll craft a mix that gives every element its place, with revision rounds until it feels exactly right to you. Then it goes to mastering, and you'll receive everything you need: final masters, stems, instrumental versions, and a clear path toward release.

This is for you if...

You have a song you believe in and want to give it the production it deserves
You're ready to show up and be part of the process, not just hand something off
You want a collaborator who cares about craft, not just someone to "make it sound professional"

This probably isn't for you if...

You want to sound exactly like someone else
You're not open to feedback on the song itself
You're looking for the cheapest option
